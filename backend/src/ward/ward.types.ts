/**
 * Ward's wire contract, as public-resource-map consumes it.
 *
 * ## Why prm hand-writes a Ward client at all
 *
 * Ward ships a tested `@ward/client` package, and prm deliberately does not
 * depend on it. The estate's apps are separate checkouts that `vps-deploy`
 * rsyncs and `npm ci`s independently, so there is no build in which a workspace
 * package from another repo resolves — every mechanism that would make one
 * resolve (a registry, a committed tarball, a git dependency) costs more in
 * build machinery and deploy credentials than the ~200 lines it saves.
 *
 * The cost is that this is security code, written five times across the estate.
 * The mitigation is that `wzd_auth/corpus/wiki/integrating.md` is the contract
 * all five are written against, and `wzd_auth/client/` remains the tested
 * reference implementation these files were adapted from. **Change the contract
 * there before changing behaviour here.**
 *
 * ## The five things this module must get right
 *
 * They are listed in that page and each is implemented with a comment naming
 * it: pin the algorithm, send the base path, send the app key, cache for 30
 * seconds, and fail closed.
 *
 * ## prm is the app where anonymous access is the common case
 *
 * Unlike the rest of the estate, most of prm is **public** — the map, the
 * places, the events. Only favourites, notifications and the admin surface need
 * a session. So prm's binding of this client is opt-in per route rather than an
 * app-wide gate, and "no cookie" is an ordinary answer here rather than an
 * error. See `ward.plugin.ts`.
